{% subsection Exercise 3 %}

-   Run an MCMC simulation to compute the posterior distribution of the
    diversification and turnover rate.
-   Look at the parameter estimates in `Tracer`. What can
    you say about the diversification, turnover, speciation and
    extinction rates? How high is the extinction rate compared with the
    speciation rate?
-   Compute the marginal likelihood under the BD model. Which model is
    supported by the data?
-   Enter the estimate in the table above.
-   Can you modify the script to use a prior on the birth drawn from a
    lognormal distribution and relative death rate drawn from a beta
    distribution so that the extinction rate is equal to the birth rate
    times the relative death rate?
    1.  Do the parameter estimates change?
    2.  What about the marginal likelihood estimates?
