### About


I am a [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/) researcher in Lyon, in the [Laboratoire de Biom√©trie et Biologie Evolutive](https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/?lang=en).

My research focuses on evolutionary genomics: how do genomes and genes evolve?
In particular, I focus on two main areas:
- the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. This can involve gene tree-species tree models, or just reconstructing trees from sequence alignments
- associations between genomes and phenotypes. In a comparative framework, across species, I'm interested in finding areas of the genome that underlie differences among species.

To investigate these two questions, I develop probabilistic models and statistical inference methods. These can rely on Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian inference, or deep learning.

Taxa of interest include Bacteria, Archaea, green plants, mammals or birds. I'm not very picky.
