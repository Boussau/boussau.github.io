1 : models of sequence evolution: went OK, did not explain well conditional probability, marginal probability. Need to use the right terms. Would be better to have an interactive simulator for a single site.
2 : Criteria for phylogenetic reconstruction: was perturbated because Alexis wanted to do parsimony and used 98 slides instead of my 20. Posterior probability was pushed back to begining of "common models of nt subst", and did not do distance methods well, which is probably OK. Likelihood function: use an interactive version as well (and correct the impression for synchronism between independent subtrees). Explanation of the pruning algorithm went OK, but Alexis felt different and reexplained it later. Again, interactive version would help. Details of Bayesian inference of phylogeny were not useful, because Mike presented them later.
5 : Common models of nt substitution: Use interactive version for time reversibility. A lot of time is spent on the different (simple) models, we can probably save time here. An interactive app to show what happens when there is more or less heterogeneity in exchangeability rates vs stationary frequencies would be good (in parallel with the phylogeography example). Then the presentation of different ways to model across sites rate heterogeneity is a bit long. Perhaps it could be simplified. Did not get enough time to do across site process heterogeneity, or across branch. So maybe we can do better, by unifying rate and process and showing that they have the same underlying modelling concepts. I think the scale notebook helped to understand the role of the scale parameter. 
8 : Bayesian model selection: we spent way too long on that, in particular on Stepping Stone. We need to focus on the basic idea, and do not give it more time than it deserves. We obtained extra time because Alexis abandonned his sequence placement course so that we could finish the tutorial.
