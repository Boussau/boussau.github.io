<figcaption>Split-frequency difference plot for the GTR model. Each dot represents a split; the x-coordinate is the average posterior probability of that split (among the two runs), and the y-coordinate is the difference in split frequencies between the two runs for that split.
We can reject the hypothesis that the two runs are sampling from the same posterior distribution for a particular split if the corresponding dot is above the concave curve (i.e., is outside the grey region).</figcaption>
