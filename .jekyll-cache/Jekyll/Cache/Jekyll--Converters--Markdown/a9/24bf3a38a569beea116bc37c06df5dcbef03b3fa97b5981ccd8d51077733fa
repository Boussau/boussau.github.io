I"V<p><em>Branch-length tree obtained from the timetree by multiplying the branch
lengths with randomly chosen rates. The rates are sampled from
two log-normal distributions introducing frequent minor, and sparse major rate
modifications, respectively. The alignment used for inference was simulated
along this tree using the JC model.</em></p>
